# Code for Denver Projects
Tracking Code for Denver's projects


## Why
In the several years that Code for Denver has existed, we have adapted our process several times in order to work towards creating the greatest impact in the community. This is our current working process based on what we have learned from experience over the last few years, and discussions with other Code for America Brigades.
