Stage Checklists
> Complete checklists for each stage in process before moving forward

### Idea Phase (pre-pitch)
- [ ] Have an idea/problem
- [ ] Complete initial validation checklist:
  - [ ] Focused on helping the community
  - [ ] We work **"with"** not **"for"**
  - [ ] Projects that are reusable
  - [ ] **Not illegal**
  - [ ] **Not promoting a particular political party or religious group**
  - [ ] **Not antagonistic to government**
  - [ ] **Not "free work"**
- [ ] Fill out top of this card with problem statement, why, etc.
- [ ] Coordinate with CfD member to get pitch on agenda for pitch night (first Monday of the month)

### Pitching Phase
- [ ] Move card to Pitches/Presentation list in waffle if you are presenting tonight
- [ ] Present to group (3 min limit)
- [ ] Group Q&A (3 min - if there is additional questions that can happen in the follow up pomodoro)
- [ ] Initial vote on whether ready for Exploration Phase.
  - Cards that are voted ready should get "Pitched - Accepted" label
  - One pomodoro for further discussion around any cards that were not determined quite ready for Exploration. Presenter should be ready to discuss, answer any questions, and revise pitch.
  - Quick update after pomodoro from presenters
- Group determines next step in final vote:
  - a) Idea needs more development (card is moved back to Ideas list with label “Needs development”
  - b) Idea is accepted but group doesn’t have resources to take on right now (card stays in pitch column with label “Pitched - Accepted”)
  - c) Idea is accepted and group has the capacity to take on (ie, the team is under the WIP limit for taking on projects)
- If outcome c) is determined:
  - [ ] a) Identify project champion
  - [ ] b) Create project waffle board from Project Bootstrapper
- If the above steps cannot be completed, then the project outcome should actually be B above, and project card stays in Pitches list with label “Pitched - Accepted”

### Exploration Phase
This phase involves no actual building (e.g. programming), and requires you have a project champion
- [ ] Create new project repo and waffle board with: https://cfd-new.herokuapp.com/
- [ ] Follow pre-populated waffle board steps to:
  - [ ] Validate the problem is worth solving, and hasn't already been addressed
  - [ ] Discover and connect with your users
  - [ ] Connect with experts and partners
  - [ ] Brainstorm solutions
  - [ ] Paper prototype
  - [ ] Validate paper prototype design is actually useful
  - [ ] Define a testable MVP
  - [ ] Prepare a pitch for Active Development
  - [ ] Identify project tech lead (if applicable)
- The pitch acceptance process to move into `Active Development` is the same as for the [Pitching Phase](#pitching-phase)

### Active Development Phase
Active development is where a team invests in developing an minimum viable product (MVP), and then based on the feedback iterates and continues development.
