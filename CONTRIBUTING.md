# So you're interested in pitching a project idea? Great!

Here is what you need to know:


### What Sorts of projects does Code for Denver work on?
- Focused on helping the community
- We work **"with"** not **"for"**
- Projects that are reusable
- Make use of the expertise in the room
- Projects that the Code for Denver members can help shape and direct

### Projects that we don't take
- Anything illegal
- Promoting a particular political or relegious group
- Antagonistic to government
- "Free Work"

If you want to see some examples of types of projects we will take on you can see that [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1k5xG6qdqwC0XFu2U5T2DhJtyXk13lh1hdsiIMUFVNNg)

## Steps to Present Your Idea

1. [Create a new issue for this repository](https://github.com/codefordenver/projects/issues/new)
2. Title the issue with a brief but descriptive title (e.g. Code for Denver Site)
3. Note that the issue should be pre-populated with a project template (if it isn't you can copy and paste the template from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codefordenver/projects/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md))
4. Fill out what you know about the top section of this template.
5. Go through the checklist under the [Idea Phase Section](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md#idea-phase-pre-pitch)
5. Once you are done with this checklist the issue can be moved into the 'pitching phase' on the [waffle board](https://waffle.io/codefordenver/projects)
6. Present the idea in 3 or less minutes at the 'pitch night'
7. Continue to move through the checklists for each phase before continuing on to the next, and make sure to ask the CfD leadership if you have any questions

## What is expected from the 'pitch'?

- Short
- Focused primarily on why (the what may evolve with input from partners, the group, and in general as more information as learned)

> We look forward to hearing your ideas on how to improve the community :smile:
